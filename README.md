# Google Slides API Codelab

In this codelab, you’ll learn how you can use [Google Slides API](https://developers.google.com/slides/) as a custom presentation tool for an analysis of the most common software licenses. You’ll be querying all open source code on GitHub using [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/) and creating a slide deck using Google Slides API to present your results. The sample application is built using Node.js, but the same basic principles are applicable to any architecture.
